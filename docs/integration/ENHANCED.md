# WEAP Website Enhanced Security Features

This README provides an overview of the enhanced security features that have been added to the WEAP website to improve security, validation, and user experience without modifying the existing codebase.

## Overview

The enhanced features are designed to work alongside the existing code without modification. They provide:

1. **Secure File Handling** - Client and server-side utilities for secure file uploads and processing
2. **Enhanced Form Validation** - Consistent validation between client and server
3. **Improved Error Handling** - Better user feedback for form errors and file uploads

## Directory Structure

The enhanced features are organized in a way that doesn't interfere with existing code:

```

## Installation

No installation is required beyond the existing project setup. However, we've added one new dependency:

```bash
# In the client directory
npm install yup --save
```

This adds the Yup validation library for better form validation.

## Usage

### 1. Enhanced File Upload Component

```tsx
import EnhancedFileUpload from '../components/enhanced/EnhancedFileUpload';

// In your component
<EnhancedFileUpload
  label="Upload Document"
  required={true}
  onChange={(fileData) => {
    // Handle file data
    console.log(fileData);
  }}
  onError={(error) => {
    // Handle error
    console.error(error);
  }}
/>
```

### 2. Enhanced Form Hook

```tsx
import useEnhancedForm from '../hooks/enhanced/useEnhancedForm';

// In your component
const {
  values,
  errors,
  handleChange,
  handleBlur,
  handleSubmit,
  handleFileChange,
  isSubmitting
} = useEnhancedForm({
  initialValues: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    message: ''
  },
  onSubmit: async (values) => {
    // Submit your form
    await api.submitForm(values);
  }
});

// In your render method
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {/* Form fields using the enhanced handlers */}
</form>
```

### 3. Server-side File Validation

```js
// In your route file
const validateFile = require('../middleware/enhanced/fileValidation');
const fileUtils = require('../utils/enhanced/fileUtils');

// Add validation middleware to your route
router.post('/contact', validateFile({ optional: true }), async (req, res) => {
  // Your route handler
  // req.file will contain the validated file if one was uploaded
});
```

## Security Features

The enhanced components provide numerous security improvements:

- **File Size Validation** - Prevents uploading of excessively large files
- **File Type Validation** - Restricts uploads to allowed file types
- **File Name Sanitization** - Prevents path traversal attacks
- **Content Type Validation** - Validates MIME types
- **Secure File Storage** - Stores files with unique names in a controlled directory
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding** - Securely transmits files between client and server
- **Path Traversal Protection** - Prevents attackers from accessing files outside the upload directory

## Documentation

## Gradual Adoption

These enhanced components can be gradually adopted without disrupting existing functionality. Start by replacing the most critical parts of your application, such as file uploads in contact forms.
