# WEAP Website Enhanced Features Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the enhanced features into your existing WEAP website without modifying any existing code.

## Backend Integration

1. Add the following to your `server.js` file right after creating your Express app, but before defining routes:

```javascript
// Integrate enhanced features
const enhance = require('./enhance');
enhance(app);
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save jsonwebtoken http-errors express-validator
```

3. Set up environment variables by adding the following to your `.env` file:

```
# JWT Secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here_replace_with_a_strong_random_string

# JWT Expiration time
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Upload file size limit
UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=5242880
```

## Frontend Integration

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install --save axios yup
```

2. Set up environment variables by adding the following to your `.env` file in the client directory:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

3. Import and use the enhanced components in your React components:

```jsx
import { EnhancedContactForm } from './components/enhanced';

function ContactPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Contact Us</h1>
      <EnhancedContactForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Features Added

The enhanced features include:

1. **Backend**:
   - MongoDB Contact model integration
   - RESTful API endpoints for contacts
   - Secure file handling and validation
   - JWT authentication
   - Input validation and sanitization

2. **Frontend**:
   - Enhanced contact form with validation
   - File upload with client-side validation
   - API integration

## Directory Structure

- `server/models/Contact.js` - MongoDB Contact model
- `server/controllers/contactController.js` - Contact API controllers
- `server/routes/api/contacts.js` - Contact API routes
- `server/middleware/enhanced/` - Enhanced middleware (auth, file validation)
- `server/utils/enhanced/` - Enhanced utilities (file handling)
- `client/src/components/enhanced/` - Enhanced React components
- `client/src/services/contactService.ts` - Contact API service

## No Modification Required

All enhanced features are designed to coexist with your existing code without requiring any modifications to existing files. The integration approach is non-intrusive and allows for gradual adoption.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during integration:

1. Check the server logs for any backend errors
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed
3. Make sure environment variables are properly set
4. Verify that the enhanced features are imported correctly

## Security Features

The enhanced features include several security best practices:

- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file handling
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection

## Next Steps

After successful integration, you can:

1. Customize the contact form styling to match your design
2. Add more routes and controllers for other features
3. Implement administrative interface for managing contacts
4. Add more authentication features like user registration and login
